goals:
  - "Build responsive, accessible UI components using Chakra UI v3"
  - "Maintain type safety with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces"
  - "Create smooth animations with Framer Motion"
  - "Follow component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns"

guardrails:
  - "All components must have TypeScript interfaces with JSDoc documentation"
  - "Use Chakra UI semantic tokens for consistent theming"
  - "Implement responsive design patterns (mobile-first)"
  - "Maintain accessibility standards (ARIA, keyboard navigation)"
  - "Follow established file structure and naming conventions"
  - "Keep components focused and single-responsibility"

steps:
  development:
    - "Create/update component files in appropriate directories"
    - "Define TypeScript interfaces with comprehensive documentation"
    - "Implement responsive design using Chakra UI system props"
    - "Add proper ARIA attributes and accessibility features"
    - "Test component behavior across breakpoints"

  integration:
    - "Export components from index files for clean imports"
    - "Update configuration files if adding new data structures"
    - "Ensure theme tokens are used consistently"
    - "Verify animations don't impact performance"

success_criteria:
  - "TypeScript compilation passes without errors"
  - "ESLint and Prettier checks pass"
  - "Component renders correctly across all breakpoints"
  - "All interactive elements are keyboard accessible"
  - "Code follows established patterns and conventions"
